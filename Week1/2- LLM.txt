LLM :

1- System prompt = instructions for the AI itself

It defines:

Who the AI should behave like

What rules it must follow

Style, tone, format

Restrictions and priorities

👉 The user usually does not see this directly.

Example :

You are a helpful Python tutor.
Explain concepts in simple English.
Always give code examples.
Do not exceed 150 words.

==> Effect:

The model will answer like a teacher

Keep responses short

Focus on Python explanations


2- User prompt = the actual question or request from the user

What is a Python list?

The model answers based on:

👉 System prompt rules
👉 + Your user prompt content
